# Penguin-species---classification-system
This project is based on penguin species classification containing physical measurements of three penguin species - Adielle,  chinstrap and gentoo. 
This project focuses on predicting the penguin species based on its physical characteristics

Overview

The Penguin Species Classification System is a machine learning project designed to predict the species of penguins based on physical and geographical attributes.
Using the Palmer Penguins dataset from Kaggle, this project serves as a modern alternative to the classic Iris dataset for learning and demonstrating data analysis, visualization, and classification techniques.

The model classifies penguins into three species:
1.Adélie
2.Chinstrap
3.Gentoo

Project - Overview:

Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the penguin species using measurable biological features. 
This helps demonstrate concepts like data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset Description:
Dataset Source: https://Palmer Penguins Dataset on Kaggle.com 
Description:
The dataset contains detailed physical measurements collected from penguins living in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
It provides an opportunity to explore biological data and build classification models in an educational and research context.

Problem Type:

This is a supervised machine learning classification problem, where the target variable (species) has three classes.
The aim is to predict the correct class (species) based on the input features.

Technologies & Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

1.pandas – Data manipulation
2.numpy – Numerical computation
3.matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization
4.scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation
5.joblib – Model serialization and saving

Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection

* Import dataset using pandas.
* Inspect data structure, shape, and types.

2. Data Preprocessing
*Handle missing values.
*Encode categorical features (like island and sex).
*Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*Visualize distributions and correlations between features.
*Compare measurements across species using plots (e.g., pairplots, boxplots, histograms).

4. Model Building
*Split data into training and testing sets.
*Train multiple classification models such as:
1. Logistic Regression
2.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3.Decision Tree Classifier
4.Random Forest Classifier
Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or cross-validation.

5. Model Evaluation
*Evaluate performance using metrics:
*Accuracy Score
*Confusion Matrix
*Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

6. Model Saving and Deployment (Optional)
* Save the trained model using joblib.

The model can be integrated into a simple web app using Streamlit or Flask.
